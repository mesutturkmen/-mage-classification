In this project we will make image classification using Transfer Learning. For this purpose we will use the InceptionResNetV2 model which is trained on the imageNet data set. Lets use a submarine image for classification. I found this image in Internet, this image is not included in imageNet dataset which was used for training InceptionResNetV2
